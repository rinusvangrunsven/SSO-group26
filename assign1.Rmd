## \textcolor{blue}{Exercises}

### Exercise 1.1

The data that is being used in the exercise is retrieved via the following command:
# ```{r}
# data_read_1 = read.table("/Users/rinusvangrunsven/Documents/Study/UvA/SSO/week2/birthweight.txt",header=TRUE)
# ```
```{r}
data_read_1 = read.table("./birthweight.txt",header=TRUE)
```

**(a)** 
Below are the histogram, boxplot, and QQ-plot of the data. 

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3));hist(data_read_1$birthweight, main="Histogram birthweight");boxplot(data_read_1$birthweight, main="Boxplot birthweight");qqnorm(data_read_1$birthweight, main="QQ-plot birthweight")
```
The figures above all show indications of a normal distribution: the histogram is symmetrical and bell-shaped, the boxplot has roughly equally distanced whiskers, and the qq-plot has an almost straight line from the bottom left to top right corner.

Below a summary of the data
```{r}
summary(data_read_1)
```

The mean, rounded to three decimals
```{r}
m = round(mean(data_read_1$birthweight),2)
m
```

**(b)** 
```{r}
mu=0.2
n = length(data_read_1$birthweight); n # calculates the length
s = round(sd(data_read_1$birthweight), 3); s # calculates standard deviation
t = round(qt(0.95,df=length(data_read_1$birthweight)-1),3); t   # calculates test statistic
ci = round(c(m-t*s/sqrt(n),m+t*s/sqrt(n)), 3); ci # 90% confidence interval
```


The length is: `r length(data_read_1$birthweight)`. This is calculated with the following formula:
```{r}
n = length(data_read_1$birthweight)
n
```

The standard deviation is: `r format(sd(data_read_1$birthweight), digits = 2)`. This is calculated with the following formula:
```{r}
s = round(sd(data_read_1$birthweight), 3)
s
```

The test statistic is: `r qt(0.95,df=length(data_read_1$birthweight)-1)`. This is calculated with the following formula:
```{r}
t = round(qt(0.95,df=length(data_read_1$birthweight)-1),3)
t
```

The confidence interval is then calculated with the formula: c(m-t*s/sqrt(n),m+t*s/sqrt(n)) 

```{r}
round(c(m-t*s/sqrt(n),m+t*s/sqrt(n)), 3)
```

**(c)** 
H0: mean birthweight is equal or smaller than 2800
H1: mean birthweight is bigger than 2800
```{r}
t.test(data_read_1$birthweight,mu=2800,alt="g") 
```

The p-value is smaller than 0,05. This means that there is enough statistical evidence to reject H0 and thus to state that H1 is true.

**(d)** 
It's different because in b) we calculated a confidence interval with a 90% confidence level, while the T-test that was conducted at c) calculated a confidence interval with a 95%  confidence level. A confidence interval is a range of values that has a upper and lower bound below and above the mean of your statistics. The population parameter that you are trying to find would have to fall in this range based on the confidence level. A confidence level is the degree of certainty that the population value would fall in this range. The more you are certain that the population parameter will fall in this range, the wider the range will get. So a 90% confidence level will have a smaller range and thus a smaller confidence interval than a 95% confidence level would have. 
It is one-sided because we wanted to check if the mean birthweight is bigger than 2800. Therefore, the upper bound of the confidence interval does not have a value but goes to infinity as it does not matter which value it is. The null hypothesis is rejected as long as the value is bigger than the lower bound.



### Exercise 1.4

The following data is being used for this exercise:
```{r}
data_read_4 = read.table("./austen.txt",header=TRUE)
```

**(a)** 
It is unclear by whom Sense and Emma are written. For the other two novels it is not: Sand1 is written by Austen and Sand2 is written by an admirer. Our guess is that Sense and Emma ar written by Austen as well and we will use this assumption while conducting the other exercises also. 
Furthermore, we presumed that the test would be performed in order to check to what extend the novels are all written in the same way. 
According to us, a test for homogeneity is the most suitable option to use. This test is able to check if the distribution of words is evenly spread across columns when comparing rows with each other. The distribution should be the same across rows in case the writing style is the same in all the novels.  
<!-- Another option would be to run a test for independence and see if the results show a difference between the Austen-columns  -->
<!-- (sense, emma, and sand1) on one side, and the admirer-column (sand2) on the other hand.  -->
<!-- I'm not sure if the two sentences above are correct -->

**(b)** 
We start with making a matrix of only the novels that Austen wrote. The matrix is shown below.
```{r}
Sense = data_read_4$Sense
Emma = data_read_4$Emma
Sand1 = data_read_4$Sand1
x=as.data.frame(matrix(c(Sense, Emma, Sand1),ncol=3,nrow=6)) 
dimnames(x)=list(c("a","an", "this", "that", "with", "without"),c("Sense","Emma", "Sand1")) 
x
```
Now that we only have the data of Austens novels, we can run a chi-squared test to see if Austen herself was consistent in her writing style or not. We will use the following hypotheses:
H0: the distribution of words is the same for each column 
H1: the distribution of words is not the same for each column
This is performed in R with the command below

```{r}
z = chisq.test(x)
z
```

The p-value is 0.1308 and this is greater than 0.05 (or 5%). This means that there is not enough statistical evidence to reject H0, and thus we conclude that the distribution of words is the same for each column. As a result of this, we conclude that Austen was consistent in her writing style. 

Shall we include the parts below?
```{r}
z$expected
z$observed
X2=sum((z$observed-z$expected)^2/z$expected)
X2
```



And this also?
```{r}
1-pchisq(X2,df=(6-1)*(3-1)) # same is the same as the p-value we got from the Chi-squared test.
residuals(z) 
```
 

**(c)** 
Since we are going to use all data, we have to add the data from the novel written by the admirer to our current matrix. This is done with the code below.
```{r}
Sand2 = data_read_4$Sand2
x=as.data.frame(matrix(c(Sense, Emma, Sand1, Sand2),ncol=4,nrow=6))
dimnames(x)=list(c("a","an", "this", "that", "with", "without"),c("Sense","Emma", "Sand1", "Sand2"))
x
```
The matrix now consists of data from all novels. We will again use a chi-squared test in order to test whether the admirer was successful in imitating Austen's style. We run a test for homogeneity since we test if the admirer was successful in imitating Austen's writing style. The hypotheses will therefore be:
H0: the distribution of words is the same for each column 
H1: the distribution of words is not the same for each column
The chi-squared test is performed in R with the command below

```{r}
z = chisq.test(x)
z
```

The p-value is 0.1208 and this is greater than 0.05 (or 5%). This means that there is not enough statistical evidence to reject H0, and thus we conclude that the distribution of words is the same for each column. As a result of this, we conclude that the admirer was successful in imitating Austen's writing style.

Shall we include the code below as well?
<!-- z$expected -->
<!-- z$observed -->
<!-- X2=sum((z$observed-z$expected)^2/z$expected) -->
<!-- X2 -->
<!-- 1-pchisq(X2,df=(6-1)*(4-1)) -->
<!-- residuals(z) -->

We also ran a second test in order to confirm if our conclusion stated above. For this second test we only took one novel of Austen and compared this with the one from the admirer. A new matrix was made for this, see below.

```{r}
sand2 = data_read_4$Sand2
x=as.data.frame(matrix(c(Sand1, Sand2),ncol=2,nrow=6))
dimnames(x)=list(c("a","an", "this", "that", "with", "without"),c("Sand1", "Sand2"))
x
```
A chi-squared test was conducted on these numbers. The result is shown below.
```{r}
z = chisq.test(x)
z
```

The p-value is 0.1308 and this is again greater than 0.05 (or 5%). This means that there is not enough statistical evidence to reject H0, and thus we conclude that the distribution of words is the same for each column. As a result of this, we conclude that the admirer was successful in imitating Austen's writing style. 

Shall we include the code below as well?
<!-- z$expected -->
<!-- z$observed -->
<!-- X2=sum((z$observed-z$expected)^2/z$expected) -->
<!-- X2 -->
<!-- 1-pchisq(X2,df=(6-1)*(4-1)) -->
<!-- residuals(z) -->



## Introduction to R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax 
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. R Markdown files permit 
you to interweave R code with ordinary text to produce well-formatted 
data analysis reports that are easy to modify. The R Markdown file itself 
shows the readers exactly how you got the results in your report.
For more details on using R Markdown 
see [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button, a document will be generated that 
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks 
within the document. For inline R code, surround code with back ticks and r. 
R replaces inline code with its results. For example, two plus one is `r 2+1`;
for the build-in R dataset `cars`, there were `r nrow(cars)` 
cars studied. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Figures

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3.5}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to 
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. Use knitr options 
to style the output of a chunk. Place options in brackets above the chunk.
Other options with the defaults are: the `eval=FALSE` option just displays 
the R code (and does not run it); `warning=TRUE` whether to display 
warnings; `tidy=TRUE` wraps long code so it does not run off the page.

You can control the size and placement of figures. For example, 
you can put two figures (or more) next to each other. 
Use `par(mfrow=c(n,m))` to create `n` by `m` plots in one picture in R.
You can adjust the proportions of figures by using the `fig.width` 
and `fig.height` chunk options. These are specified in inches, 
and will be automatically scaled down to fit within the handout margin.
Chunk option `fig.align`  takes values `left`, `right`, or `center` 
(to align figures in the output document).

```{r,fig.margin = TRUE,fig.width=6,fig.height=3,fig.align="center"}
par(mfrow=c(1,2)); x1=rnorm(50); hist(x1); qqnorm(x1)
```

You can arrange for figures to span across the entire page by using 
the `fig.fullwidth` chunk option. 

```{r,fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.height=3}
plot(iris$Sepal.Length,iris$Petal.Length,xlab="Sepal.Length",ylab="Petal.Length")
```

More about chunk options can be found at [\textcolor{blue}{https://yihui.name/knitr/options/}](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/).

### Equations

You can also include \LaTeX\ expessions/equations in your report:
inline $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)$ and 
in the display mode:
\[
\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x).
\]
To possibly avoid \LaTeX\ expressions in you report 
(you do not really need \LaTeX\ for your reports), 
remove this part (part **Equations**) and try to knit 
your Rmd-file. 

### Footnotes

Here is the use of a footnote^[This is a footnote.]. 

<!-- ### Images -->
<!-- Want an image? This will do it.  -->
<!-- To depict an image (say, `my_image.jpg` which should be in your current working directory), use this command  -->

<!-- ![caption for my image](my_image.jpg) -->

### Tables

Want a table? This will create one (note that the separators 
*do not* have to be aligned).

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4 


You can also make table by using knit's `kable` function:

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(mtcars[1:5,],caption="A knit kable.")
```

### Block quote
> This will create a block quote, 
> if you want one.

### Verbatim
```
This text is displayed verbatim/preformatted.
```

### Links
Links: http://example.com, [in-text link to Google](http://google.com),
[linked phrase](http://example.com).

### Italicized and embolded text
- Single asterisks italicize text *like this*. 
- Double asterisks embolden text **like this**.

One more way: _italic_ and __bold__.

## \textcolor{blue}{Exercises}

### Exercise 1

**(i)** Here are some consequitive R-commands.
```{r}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
x=rnorm(100)
```
Now the same code chunk but with all the output collapsed into signle block.
```{r, collapse=TRUE}
x=rep(c("A","B"),each=5); x
sample(x)
x=rnorm(100)
```

**(ii)** Below we perform a one sample t-test for the artificial date 
(that we generated ourselves).
```{r}
mu=0.2
x=rnorm(100,mu,1) # creating artificial data
t.test(x,mean=0)   # t.test(x,alternative=c("two.sided"),conf.level=0.95,mu=10)
```

**(iii)** We often do not need to report the whole output of R-commands, 
only certain values of the output. For example, below we perform 
a two-sample t-test and report only the (appropriately rounded) values 
of t-statistics and the p-pavue.

```{r}
mu=0;nu=0.5
x=rnorm(50,mu,1); y=rnorm(50,nu,1) # creating artificial data
ttest=t.test(x,y) 
```

The value of t-statistics in the above evaluation is  
`r round(ttest[[1]],2)` and the p-value is `r round(ttest[[3]],4)`.
