### Exercise 2.1

**a)** 



### Exercise 2.2

TODO: run assumptions


**a)**
```{r}
df = read.table("./treeVolume.txt", header=TRUE)

# Does the type affect the volume?
fit = aov(volume ~ type, data=df)
#summary(treevollm) 
summary(fit)
```

The F value is not very high, and the p value is not very small. Therefore it seems (in this test) that the volume is not dependent on the type.

TODO: explain more

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(y=volume, x=type, fill=type))+
  stat_summary(fun.y="mean", geom="bar",position="dodge")+
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "errorbar", position="dodge",width=.8)

```

TODO explain chart

**b)**
```{r}

fit2 = aov(volume ~ type + diameter + height, data=df)
summary(treeancovalm)
```
```{r}
predict()

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
